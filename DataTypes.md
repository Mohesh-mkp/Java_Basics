# Data Types in JAVA:

- Java is Statically typed language which means we need to declare the variable explicitely.
- Basically it is of two types
    -  Primitive Data Type
    -  Non-Primitive Data Type

## Primitive Data Type:
Primitive Data Types are single values and no special abilities.   
There are 8 primitive data types

### 1. Boolean Data Type:
Boolean data type represents only one bit of information either true or false which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra, 
but the size of the boolean data type is virtual machine-dependent. Values of type boolean are not converted implicitly or explicitly (with casts) to any other type. 
But the programmer can easily write conversion code.   
```
Syntax:  boolean boolvar;
size: Virtual Machine dependant
Range of values: true, false
```
### 2. Byte Data Type:
The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer. The byte data type is useful for saving memory in large arrays.
```
Syntax:  byte bytevar;
size: 1 byte (8 bit)
Range of values: -128 to 127
```
### 3. Short Data Type:
The short data type is a 16-bit signed two’s complement integer. Similar to byte, use a short to save memory in large arrays, in situations where the memory savings actually matters.
```
Syntax:  short shortvar;
size: 2 bytes (16 bit)
Range of values: -32,768 to 32,767
```
### 4. Integer Data Type:
It is a 32-bit signed two’s complement integer.
```
Syntax:  int intvar;
size: 4 bytes (32 bit)
Range of values: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
```
### 5. Long Data Type:
The range of a long is quite large. The long data type is a 64-bit two’s complement integer and is useful for those occasions where an 
int type is not large enough to hold the desired value. The size of the Long Datatype is 8 bytes (64 bits).
```
Syntax:  long longvar;
size: 8 bytes (64 bit)
Range of values: (-2**64 to (2**64)-1)
```
### 6. Float Data Type:
The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. Use a float (instead of double) 
if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers. The size of the float data type is 4 bytes (32 bits).
```
Syntax:  float floatvar;
size: 4 bytes (32 bit)
Range of values: upto 7 decimals
```
### 7. Double Data type:
The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. For decimal values, 
this data type is generally the default choice. The size of the double data type is 8 bytes or 64 bits.
```
Syntax:  double doublevar;
size: 8 bytes (64 bit)
Range of values: upto 16 decimals
```
### 8. Char Data Type:
The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character with the size of 2 bytes (16 bits).
```
Syntax:  char charevar;
size: 2 bytes (16 bit)
Range of values: characters representation of ASCII values 0 to 255
```

## Non-Premitive Data Type:
